# AIMO Interpretability Challenge

This repo contains a guideline for developing and submitting a method into the [AIMO Interpretability Challenge](https://aimo-interp.github.io/). It uses the
**representation classifier probe** as a complete, working example.

## What your method does

For each model and batch of mathematical problems, your method predicts whether
the model's behavior is robust:

```python
are_robust(model_id: str, problems: list[str]) -> list[bool]
```

The ingestion program validates this exact annotated signature. The returned
list must:

- contain exactly one prediction per input problem;
- preserve the input order;
- contain real Python `bool` values, not integers or NumPy boolean scalars;
- use `True` for robust and `False` for not robust.

Your method can load the specified language model (`model_id`) through Hugging
Face, run inference on the supplied `problems`, and predict whether the model is
robust on each problem. You may use or extend any available Hugging Face
functionality and combine signals from the forward pass to produce the
robustness predictions.

Model weights for every evaluated `model_id` are available through the
evaluation worker's offline Hugging Face cache; see
[Evaluation environment](#evaluation-environment) for the list. As the evaluation runs offline, you will not have
access to other HF models.

## Prerequisites

You need:

- Python 3.11+ and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for the local tooling;
- `git` to clone the repository;
- Docker, if you want to reproduce the offline evaluation container locally
  (recommended before submitting).

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:aimo-interp/getting-started.git
cd getting-started
uv sync
```

## Quick start

The fastest path from a fresh clone to a scored local run:

```bash
# 1. Import the public validation sample into data/val-sample/.
uv run scripts/import_hf_dataset.py

# 2. Score the example method on that sample.
uv run scripts/run_local.py solutions/trained-probe \
  --input-dir data/val-sample/input \
  --reference-dir data/val-sample/reference
```

Without a trained probe artifact, the example predicts `False` for every case
(a valid but trivial baseline). The rest of this guide explains how to plug in a
real artifact, package a submission, and validate it. To write your own method,
copy `solutions/trained-probe/` and replace the implementation behind
`are_robust`.

## Which data is available?

### Public development data

The public validation sample is
[`aimo-interp/val-sample`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aimo-interp/val-sample).
It contains examples with:

- `model_id`: the model whose robustness is being evaluated;
- `original_problem`: the mathematical problem text;
- `permutation_type`: the relevant perturbation categories;
- `model_is_robust`: the public development label.

Import it into this repository with:

```bash
uv run scripts/import_hf_dataset.py
```

This creates:

```text
data/val-sample/
├── input/
│   └── cases.jsonl
├── reference/
│   └── labels.jsonl
└── metadata.json
```

The public labels are for development only. The final evaluation uses separate
private problems and labels.

### Data available during evaluation

For each call, the trained probe receives a `model_id` and a list of `str`.

Your submission does not receive case IDs, reference labels, private dataset
files, or network access.

## Example method: trained representation probe

This baseline demonstrates how to compose a solution.

Start with this directory:

```text
trained-probe/
├── solution.py
├── probe_inference.py
└── probe_artifacts/
    └── probe_artifact.pkl
```

The `solution.py` file defines only the Codabench interface:

```python
from probe_inference import predict_robustness

def are_robust(model_id: str, problems: list[str]) -> list[bool]:
    return predict_robustness(model_id, problems)
```

`probe_inference.py` contains the implementation in three sections:

1. **Artifact loading:** find and validate `probe_artifact.pkl`.
2. **Hidden-state extraction:** load the offline model, format the problem,
   perform a forward pass, and select the final prompt-token representation
   from the model layer.
3. **Probe scoring:** apply a collection of linear probes and average their
   margins.

For one probe, the decision is:

```python
margin = weights @ hidden_state + bias - threshold
prediction = margin >= 0
```

The ensemble averages these margins and returns `True` when the mean is
non-negative. The artifact stores weights, biases, thresholds, the selected
layer, the Hugging Face model ID, and the system prompt. It does not contain
precomputed hidden states.

## Example method: uncertainty profiling

The repository also provides `solutions/uncertainty-profiling/`. This baseline
generates a deterministic response to each original problem and summarizes the
generated-token distributions with 14 confidence and uncertainty statistics.
A pretrained scikit-learn regressor maps those features to predicted absolute
accuracy decay; the artifact's cross-validated threshold converts the score to
the required robustness boolean.

The motivation is to measure robustness through uncertainty over the model's
generated reasoning trace: robust and spurious reasoning may produce different
token-level uncertainty signatures. This follows the general perspective of
[Tracing Uncertainty in Language Model "Reasoning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.07776),
while using a simpler set of 14 aggregate trace features.

Training is deliberately separate from submission inference. Generate a
resumable feature cache from the pinned public aggregate dataset:

```bash
uv run solutions/uncertainty-profiling/scripts/compute_uncertainty_features.py \
  --cache-dir /path/to/huggingface/cache
```

Then select the regressor and threshold with grouped cross-validation, refit on
all feature rows, and export the joblib artifact directly into the solution:

```bash
uv run solutions/uncertainty-profiling/scripts/train_uncertainty_regressor.py \
  --feature-data-path \
  data/uncertainty-profiling/deepseek-ai_DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B_confidence_features.parquet
```

The resulting solution is offline and self-contained. During evaluation it
resolves the Codabench alias `qwen3-8b:low` to the cached
`deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B` checkpoint, then loads the matching
bundled regressor artifact. It uses greedy decoding with a 2,048-token prompt
cap and a 4,096-token response cap. See
`solutions/uncertainty-profiling/README.md` for the complete feature list,
artifact provenance, and CV search.

## Runtime and available libraries

The evaluation container is offline. It does not run `pip install`, `uv sync`,
or a submitted `requirements.txt`.

**You may rely only on the Python standard library and packages provided by
[`Dockerfile.competition`](Dockerfile.competition).** The current runtime
provides:

- PyTorch `2.12.1` with CUDA `13.2`;
- Accelerate `1.13.0`;
- Hugging Face Hub `1.22.0`;
- joblib `1.5.3`;
- pandas `3.0.3`;
- safetensors `0.8.0`;
- scikit-learn `1.8.0`;
- tokenizers `0.22.2`;
- Transformers `5.13.0`.

Important consequences:

- A package installed only on your laptop or cluster login environment will not
  exist during evaluation.
- Adding `requirements.txt` to the ZIP does not install anything.
- Artifacts serialized with scikit-learn or joblib should be trained with the
  runtime versions above.
- Model and tokenizer loading must work offline, so rely only on the model ID
  passed to `are_robust`. Do not call external APIs or download from Hugging
  Face during evaluation.
- You may include your own Python source files and pretrained data artifacts in
  the ZIP, such as pretrained probes, provided they comply with the competition
  rules.

## Evaluation environment

Each submission is evaluated on a dedicated GPU worker with the following
resources:

- **GPU:** eight NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 (Blackwell, compute capability 12.0) with
  96 GB of VRAM each. All eight are visible to the container, so
  `device_map="auto"` can shard a model that does not fit on a single card.
  The submissions share the compute environment, so the free VRAM at any moment may be less than the
  nominal total.
- **CPU and RAM:** 192 cores with ample system memory; there is no per-container
  memory cap.
- **Time limit:** 3600 seconds per evaluation run, applied separately to the
  prediction run and the scoring run. Loading the cached 8B model costs roughly
  a minute of that budget.
- **Network:** disabled inside evaluation containers. `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` and
  `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1` are preset.
- **Model cache:** a read-only Hugging Face cache is mounted at
  `/app/data/huggingface`, and `HF_HOME` already points to it, so
  `from_pretrained(...)` resolves cached models with no extra configuration.
  Pass `local_files_only=True` to fail fast on anything not cached.

Models currently available in the cache:

- `openai/gpt-oss-120b`
- `allenai/Olmo-3-7B-Instruct`
- `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B`
- `google/gemma-3-27b-it`

Every `model_id` the harness passes to `are_robust` is cached, so a method can
always load the model it is asked to judge. All four should load onto the GPUs with
`device_map="auto"` and `local_files_only=True`. 
If you encounter an OOM error, it may be a clash with another process on our Codabench server 
-- please try resubmitting and if the problem persists, please let us know.

`openai/gpt-oss-120b` is cached as plain bfloat16 rather than in its upstream
MXFP4 form, because MXFP4 weights cannot be materialized on these Blackwell
cards. This is transparent to submissions:
`from_pretrained("openai/gpt-oss-120b", local_files_only=True)` works as usual
and yields a bf16 model of about 218 GiB across the eight GPUs.

Models outside this list cannot be loaded during evaluation. Contact the
organizers if your method needs another model cached on the workers.

## What to submit

Submit one ZIP archive containing:

- `solution.py` at the archive root;
- any helper modules or Python packages imported by `solution.py`;
- all pretrained artifacts needed, such as the trained probes;
- optional configuration files.

Do not submit:

- training datasets or private labels;
- model weights already supplied by the evaluation worker;
- virtual environments, caches, `__pycache__`, or installed packages;
- credentials, API keys, or code that requires network access.

Correct ZIP layout, for the probing example:

```text
baseline-submission-bundle.zip
├── solution.py
├── probe_inference.py
└── probe_artifacts/
    └── probe_artifact.pkl
```

Incorrect ZIP layout:

```text
baseline-submission-bundle.zip
└── trained-probe/
    └── solution.py
```

Build the archive from inside the method directory:

```bash
cd trained-probe
zip -r ../baseline-submission-bundle.zip solution.py probe_inference.py probe_artifacts
cd ..
```

Verify that `solution.py` is at the root:

```bash
unzip -l baseline-submission-bundle.zip
```

## Check the submission locally

The repository already includes the method under `solutions/trained-probe/`.
Copy the exported artifact into it:

```text
solutions/
└── trained-probe/
    ├── solution.py
    ├── probe_inference.py
    └── probe_artifacts/
        └── probe_artifact.pkl
```

```bash
mkdir -p solutions/trained-probe/probe_artifacts
cp /path/to/probe_artifact.pkl \
  solutions/trained-probe/probe_artifacts/probe_artifact.pkl
```

Run the public validation sample:

```bash
uv run scripts/run_local.py solutions/trained-probe \
  --input-dir data/val-sample/input \
  --reference-dir data/val-sample/reference
```

Expected output has this shape:

```json
{
  "accuracy": 0.7,
  "coverage": 1.0,
  "invalid_predictions": 0
}
```

The accuracy shown above is only an example. Before submission, require:

- `coverage` equal to `1.0`;
- `invalid_predictions` equal to `0`;
- deterministic predictions across repeated runs;
- successful execution in the competition Docker image, not only in a local
  virtual environment.

Build all repository artifacts with:

```bash
uv run scripts/build.py all \
  --input-dir data/val-sample/input \
  --reference-dir data/val-sample/reference
```

This creates a solution ZIP. For the probing example, the output is
`dist/solution-trained-probe.zip`.

## How to submit

1. Sign in to the AIMO Interpretability Challenge on [Codabench](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/16180/#/pages-tab).
2. Open the active submission phase.
3. Upload `baseline-submission-bundle.zip` or the generated
   `dist/solution-trained-probe.zip`.
4. Wait for ingestion and scoring to finish.
5. Check `coverage` and `invalid_predictions` before interpreting accuracy.

An invalid prediction usually means the method raised an exception, returned a
non-boolean value, or returned the wrong number of predictions. Detailed
participant exceptions may be hidden by the evaluator, so reproduce failures
locally with the same Docker image.
